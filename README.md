# BasicArithmetic

This is a reusable library of basic arithmetic functions including addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponents, and Data Type Conversion. The library supports arithmetic on the following data types: int, float, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

The data types for binary, octal, and hexadecimal are in the forms of strings.

To use this library simply call the class name followed by the method name. For example if you want to add two hexadecimal numbers together you would call it from the BasicArithmetic class as: BasicArithmetic.addHex(number1, number2). Notes the values for hexidecimal numbers are strings.
